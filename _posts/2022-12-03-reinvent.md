# re:Invent 2022

My first re:Invent also happened to be the week of my first Awesomeversary.  What a great opportunity to spend time with a few Awesome folks and dig in deep on the services that run SmugMug and Flickr!

Data Beats Intuition - Intuition can get you far, but we have data available around everything that we and our customers do.  Data tells us how our services are doing, what we can do better, what our customers like and don’t like.  Multiple teams and services collect and analyze data that others may not even know exists.  It is a good reminder to ask around if you need data to help solve an issue or make a decision.

Fun fact: I actually took this photo for my wife who is the Data Supervisor for a local homeless non-profit.  In her case, the data they collect gets people housed!





Architecture - session after session we saw how different AWS services work together.  We discussed different scenarios and best practices for solving complex problems.  It is a good reminder to break out the white board and figure out how things work together before and during a build or upgrade of a product feature or service.  Especially if you’re feeling inspired to build a YogiBot.











Face time - a little face time goes a long way, especially when working remote and across locations.  If you have an opportunity to meet up with your peers, take it!  

Access to product teams - I was very impressed with the access that SmugMug has to the product teams at AWS.  They were genuinely interested in how we are using their different products and the challenges that we face.  We had the right people in the room to offer both cost and technical solutions right there.  If we need to consult with these teams as we are designing solutions or running into issues, they would be more than happy to work with us throughout the process.

AWS Credits - there was some nice swag floating around re:Invent, but an easy one to bring back are AWS Promo credits!  I posted a few of these in Slack and I have more.  Go tinker and play, go build something for yourself, give it to your kids or a friend.  





iOT - This was my last session on Friday and the one I was interested in for mostly personal reasons.  It was a great interactive session building an end-to-end iOT solution.  The project involved building out an electronic badge for a conference.  The board they used was built on the RP2040, a microcontroller designed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation and runs CircuitPython.  We set it up to feed temperature and humidity data to the cloud and to pull down photos and QR codes.  We were able to both interact through code and a real time environment with a virtual copy of this device.  AWS ExpressLink is a fascinating service to check out.

Fun fact: I found a photo of this session on my LinkedIn feed.  50 Bonusly to the first person that can find me and post in #reinvent.
